The team discussed various technical issues and resolutions related to their Kubernetes (K8s) cluster setup. They explicitly disabled Kerberos for authentication and modified the driver YAML for their workload. They faced challenges with IM modules, requiring version adjustments to avoid breaking changes. A security group issue was resolved by pushing a network policy to allow all traffic within the namespace. The cluster had issues with application submission and deadline timeouts. They are using an application node group with auto-scaling capabilities, capable of handling up to 100 nodes. The team also discussed the transition to a self-service EKS cluster for better maintenance and cost management.
