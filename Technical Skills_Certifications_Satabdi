If you’d like, I can also prepare a one-line, ATS-optimized technical skills summary for your resume so it’s recruiter-friendly. This could help highlight your expertise in big data, cloud, and DevOps in a compact form.

Here’s an ATS-optimized one-line technical skills summary for your resume:

"AWS Certified Data Engineer with 12+ years’ experience in Big Data (Apache Spark, Kafka, Hadoop, Airflow), Cloud Platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), Data Warehousing (Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery), ETL/ELT (Glue, DBT, Talend), DevOps (Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform), and advanced SQL, Python, and Scala programming."

This condenses your skills into a recruiter-friendly, keyword-rich line that will score well in ATS scans.

I can also create a version with stronger action keywords to make it sound even more impactful for hiring managers. Would you like me to prepare that?

Here’s the impact-driven, action keyword–enhanced version of your technical skills summary:

"AWS Certified Data Engineer with 12+ years’ proven expertise in designing and deploying scalable Big Data solutions (Apache Spark, Kafka, Hadoop, Airflow), architecting cloud-native data platforms on AWS, Azure, and GCP, optimizing enterprise data warehouses (Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery), engineering high-performance ETL/ELT pipelines (Glue, DBT, Talend), and implementing DevOps automation (Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform) using advanced Python, Scala, and SQL programming."

This version does three key things:

Highlights impact – “designing and deploying,” “architecting,” “optimizing” stand out more than just listing skills.

Maximizes ATS match rate – strategically repeats core technologies in context.

Positions you for senior roles – focuses on architecture, optimization, and scalability.

If you want, I can now tailor this summary specifically for a Citi full-time Senior Data Engineer position so it aligns with their job descriptions. That would boost your chances when applying internally.
